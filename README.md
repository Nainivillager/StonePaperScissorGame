This project is completely made in *Html, Css & JavaScript*.
> The structure of the document is usually composed by Html.
> Css is used for beautifying the structure and to provide resposiveness according to the different sizes.
> The JavaScript Concepts Used in this are:
>> DOM (Document Object Model) --> The Dom is an interface that allows programs and events to dynamically access and update the content, style and sturcutre of the document.
>> Event Listners --> This allows us to create custom responses to events like mouse clicks, keyboard clicks, and window resizing,
>> Callbacks with annonymous functions --> Callbacks  functions are those which can be passed as an argument to another functions,
>> loops and Math properties like floor, random, etc.
