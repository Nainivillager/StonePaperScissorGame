# Stone Paper Scissor Game

This is a simple Stone, Paper, Scissor Game in which user chooses from the given    three images of stone paper scissor.
Which is then compared with the computer's choice which is randomly generated in the background. And finally the result is shown in the result box.
The scores are also updated on every move.
This is an unlimited play game. Play until infinity.

This project is completely made in *Html, Css & JavaScript*.
I have used *javaScript events*, *js dom object*, *callback functions* and *math random method*

I also have taken the help from *Shradha khapra* from youtube
The background animation for the project is taken from another creator named *Fabio Ottaviani*
